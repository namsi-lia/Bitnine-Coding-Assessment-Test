# This README file provides information about the development environment and instructions for compiling and running the source code written in the C programming language

## Development Environment

The source code for this project was developed and tested using the following environment:

Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu)
Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the source code, follow these steps:
 1.Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository containing the source code to your local machine. You can use the following command:
 git clone <repository_url>

2.Open a terminal or command prompt.

3.Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.

4.Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command. For example, with GCC:
   gcc Question2.c -o question2.exe

5.After successful compilation, run the executable file using the following command:
    Execute the program by typing its name and pressing Enter. For example:
    ./executable_name i.e ./question2.exe

The program will then execute, and the output will be displayed in the terminal.
